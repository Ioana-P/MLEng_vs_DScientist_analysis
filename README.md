# (WORK IN PROGRESS) Exploring the London Data Science job market

Advice and information about the job market for Data Scienstists and Machine Learning (ML) Engineers abounds on the internet. 
I wanted to have a look for myself at my own sampled data and see what conclusions I could draw from it.

This project was undertaken for 3 reasons: 
1. To investigate and test hypotheses about Data Scientists, Data Analysts and ML Engineers;
2. To test presuppositions about the job market for Data Scientists / Analysts ML Engineers and
3. To demonstrate and practice data retrieval via webscraping. 

*One important caveat I must mention about the data is this: although all of the data neatly categorised as either DS, DA or MLEng is shown clearly in my data analysis and exploration, if you had to go through each job post by title you will find plenty that say "Business Analyst", "Data Engineer" or "Data Science Researcher". This is because the main method by which the data was extracted was by entering the search terms and thus the jobs are categoried **by which search term retrieved them**. This speaks volumes to the fact that:
a) there is significant semantic overlap between these terms;
b) Many such job posts include the job search terms not in the title but in the description and 
c) That our data acquisition process relies on the inner functioning of indeed.co.uk's internal search engine.

###### Therefore I retrieved Data Scientist and ML Engineer job post data from Indeed.co.uk in late May 2020 using Selenium webdriver and BeautifulSoup. The same was done on 23rd of June for Data Analyst
###### I wrangled and analysed the data in Pandas, MNLTK, Seaborn and Matplotlib. 


##### Here are 3 concrete questions I wanted to answer with this project:
1. How many job posts for this sector advertise their salary?
2. Are there any skills that differentiate the two types of job?
3. How many of the jobs seem to indicate that remote/flexible working is an option?

# Findings in brief (this list is still being expanded):

## AWS and cloud technology
* from analysing the job descriptions of both job types,the only salient major difference is mentions of AWS (Amazon Web services) are three times as high across ML Eng jobs (>600) than DS jobs (~200);
* Looking at mentions per job post:
    * the % ML jobs that mention AWS is:  32.65%
    * the % DS jobs that mention AWS is:  20.0%
* Looking at mean number of mentions of AWS:
    * (Excluding posts that DON'T mention AWS), the mean number of times an ML job post mentions AWS is 2.78
    * (Excluding posts that DON'T mention AWS), the mean number of times an DS job post mentions AWS is 1.83
* for the same search but with a broader list of terms (e.g. 'GCP', 'cloud', 'azure'), we get:
    * Excluding posts that DON'T mention cloud services at all, the mean number of times an ML job post mentions cloud services is 3.39
    * Excluding posts that DON'T mention cloud services at all, the mean number of times an DS job post mentions cloud services is 2.22

## Advertising salary:
From the sample of 2211 jobs originally collected, the percentage of job posts where we have been unable to detect salary information is 38.31% (847)

If we look at the breakdown of jobs that uniquely appear in only one search (1825 collected job posts)

* The absolute nr of DS jobs in our sample that openly state any kind of salary range is     141
* The absolute nr of DA jobs in our sample that openly state any kind of salary range is     421
* The absolute nr of ML Eng jobs in our sample that openly state any kind of salary range is 161

### The Data at a Glance (EDA)

As we can see below, Data Scientist and ML Engineering roles tend to pay more than data analyst roles, though there are a few analyst role outliers reaching up to Â£150k per annum.

![yearly_salary](https://github.com/Ioana-P/MLEng_vs_DScientist_analysis/blob/master/fig/yearly_salary_dist.jpeg)


Looking at the descriptions bigrams below (where I've included industry stopwords, such as "data", "software"), we can see some signs of divergence in general skills demanded by the job type: ML Eng having a stronger emphasis on 'best practice', 'large scale' and 'end [to] end' work. Both feature AI, although ML Eng slightly more.There are fewer clearer patterns across DS.

### Statistical tests comparing salaries between ML Engineers, Data Scientists and Data Analysts


Limitations of data: 
- sample size of 421 total (DS: 202; DA: 241; MLEng: 162).
- all 3 have unequal variances and non-normal distribution (see https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~Ioana-P/4/#/ )

Using [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) to acquire distributions of sample means for all 3 categories, 
and using [Shapiro-Wilk's Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test) to check for normality, the data now meets the 
requirements for performing [Welch's T-tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t-test). I have performed two tests, comparing 
Data Scientists vs Data Analysts and Data Scientists vs Machine Learning engineers. 

![DS vs DA](https://github.com/Ioana-P/MLEng_vs_DScientist_analysis/blob/master/fig/hypothesis_test_DS_DA_salary.jpg)
Salary comparison : data scientists vs data analysts
Cohen's d = 3.574


![DS vs MLEng](https://github.com/Ioana-P/MLEng_vs_DScientist_analysis/blob/master/fig/hypothesis_test_DS_MLEng_salary.jpg)
Salary comparison : data scientists vs machine learning engineers
Cohen's d = 0.28

The analysis suggests that, if one is purely aiming to maximise expected salary (all other things held equal / not considered, such as
skills and preferences for job requirements), you should search indeed.co.uk for "data scientist" and "machine learning engineer" roles. 
While the differences between MLEng and DS roles are not statistically negligible, the second test's power (0.68) is very low, so there's
a high change that we may have not detected the "true" effect of searching for MLEng vs DS.

### Insights and further research
[WIP]
* So far the advice of focusing on SQL is solid advice the DS and DA jobs
* For higher salary, search nand aim for DS jobs rather than DA roles
* Experience with AWS is helpful with ML Engineering positions, although it's not clear _how_ helpful (further statistical tests required)
